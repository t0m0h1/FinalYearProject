# Chatbot Roadmap: Student Mental Health and Wellbeing Assistant

## 1. Prototyping
- Expand the Flask prototype to include:
  - Basic database integration (e.g., SQLite) for storing user interactions.
  - A preliminary conversational flow with predefined intents and responses.
- Integrate with a library like `Rasa` or use a pretrained chatbot model for better natural language understanding (NLU).

---

## 2. Model Development
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Fine-tune or retrain your sentiment model to recognize nuanced emotions (e.g., anxiety, stress, joy).
- **Intent Classification**:
  - Build an intent recognition model to understand specific user queries, such as:
    - Asking for advice
    - Venting or sharing feelings
    - Requesting resources
- **Response Generation**:
  - Use advanced NLP models (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face `transformers`) for empathetic and dynamic response generation.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
  - Extract key details like dates, times, and specific issues mentioned by users.

---

## 3. Personalization
- **User Preferences**:
  - Allow users to set preferences for tailored advice and suggestions.
- **Mood Tracking**:
  - Create a feature for users to log and track their mood over time with visualized data.
- **Goal Setting**:
  - Enable users to set personal goals (e.g., improving sleep, practicing mindfulness).

---

## 4. Privacy and Data Security
- Ensure compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR):
  - Encrypt all user data.
  - Offer anonymous interaction options.
- Avoid storing sensitive data unless absolutely necessary and with user consent.

---

## 5. User Interface
- Design an intuitive and accessible UI:
  - Use tools like React, Vue.js, or Angular for web interfaces.
  - Implement a chat-like layout for natural interactions.
- Ensure the interface is responsive for both mobile and desktop users.

---

## 6. Advanced Features
- **Resources Database**:
  - Curate a list of mental health resources (e.g., articles, helpline numbers, mindfulness exercises).
- **Crisis Detection**:
  - Implement real-time detection for crisis situations and provide immediate help options (e.g., helplines, emergency contacts).
- **Gamification**:
  - Introduce achievements or rewards for completing exercises and maintaining positive habits.

---

## 7. Deployment
- Deploy the chatbot to a scalable platform:
  - Use cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
  - Optimize for low latency and high availability.
- Implement performance monitoring tools to track user interactions and app health.

---

## 8. Testing and Feedback
- Conduct beta testing with a group of students to:
  - Refine the conversational flow.
  - Identify gaps or improvements in the chatbot's responses.
- Add feedback mechanisms to allow users to report issues or suggest enhancements.

---

## 9. Launch
- Create awareness:
  - Partner with schools, universities, and mental health organizations.
  - Use social media and email campaigns to promote the chatbot.
- Provide onboarding materials to help users understand the features and benefits.

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement
- Regularly update the chatbot with:
  - New features based on user feedback.
  - Updated mental health resources.
  - Improved models for better conversation quality.
