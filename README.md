Issues log.

Still have issues finding the template/ getting server to find html

use python 3.9.12 for now.
Have noticed Python 3.10.7 is quite compatible.

Check column names in training data match those in the code.

Be careful using Windows. may have to create new virtual environment.

Is it loading intents.pkl or intents.json?
